Included here is the python code and test dataset for PCS-CPMG methodology. 

The main python script is refine_EM_PCS.py, which is a python based script written for the XPLOR-NIH software. 
This script is a modified version of the refine.py script from the XPLOR-NIH package. 

This script takes degnerate PCS data extracted from CPMG experiments and solves a high-energy structure. 
The script relies on an Expectation Maximization algorithm for handling the degenerate data. 
Running the script produces a single structure. 

Test Dataset Files: 
4AKE_Modeled.pdb - Chain A of the PDB 4AKE modeled with the Geobacillus stearothermophilus sequence.
  - Open ADK structure that is a simulated high-energy state in this case. 
4AKE_Modeled_MinorPCS_True_Co.txt - Simulated PCS generated for the 4AKE structure. 
4AKE_Modeled_FourPCS_Co.txt - Four fold degenerate simulated PCSs generated for the 4AKE structure. 
4QBH_Modeled_Hydrogens.pdb - PDB 4QBH with hydrogens added. 
  - Closed ADK structure is the simulated low-energy, highly populated state.
